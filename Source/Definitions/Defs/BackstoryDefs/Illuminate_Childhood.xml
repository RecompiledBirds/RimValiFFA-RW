    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s pack belonged to a fringe tribe of survivalists who refused to use many technologies and survived in the wild in small, hand-built shelters. [PAWN_pronoun] showed an aptitude for shooting early on, and was taught to handle a rifle at a very young age to hunt for food or defend [PAWN_possessive] pack from dangers. Discontent with living in the wild, the pack began collecting a stash of valuables, and eventually used it (and their young, adorable faces) to bribe a trade ship and get to a more civilized life.</baseDesc>
